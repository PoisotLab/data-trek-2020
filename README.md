## Project Management

### Essential elements of a regular, reproducible project folder:

- Code
- Input
- Output
- README
- LICENSE  
.git


### Structure example

```
my_project/
- code/	                 # functions, scripts, routines
- data/                  # main data folder
  - raw/ 	               # !NEVER TOUCH DIZ! 
  - clean/ 	             # if you touched raw data, you put it here now
- output/ 	             # everything that your code spitz
	- fig/ 	               # may be figures
  - results/ 	           # or other things
- README.md 	           # your future me won't know what this project is about
- LICENSE 	             # let people know what they can do with your project
- .git 	             		 # git things (we'll get to that later)
```
